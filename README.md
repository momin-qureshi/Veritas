# Veritas
Technological advancements that came with the advent of the 21st century have propelled us
in the digital era. Books have gone through a similar transformation, taking up the form of E-
books. It is estimated that by 2050, an even larger proportion of readers will rely on e-books
as a source of learning over books. The project Veritas is specifically designed to allow users
read a variety of books from various publishers. Our application will not just entirely be
reader-oriented rather it will also serve the publishers’ interests by expanding their audience
that remains restricted due to traditional distribution methods. The constant change in
technology requires a regular update on our app. There were different issues faced while
designing the database and the backend of the app. During all the specifications, we defined
and explained every type of architectural strategies, took different designs into
considerations, measured all the hardware and software requirements for the users to have a
better understanding of our app so that they can use it with ease. This document also contains
all the information i.e., high-level and low-level design, class diagram, sequence diagrams, er
diagram, tables and GUI. Coming to conclusion, we can say that this application will help the
user cater all his reading needs in his hands. He can keep track of his past books or
magazines, and even have a knowledge of what’s coming new.
